## Welcome to my personal site

I'm a (data) scientist at UBC who focuses on questions related to animal
locomotion, vision, and evolutionary biology.

My research asks how musculoskeletal and visual systems allow animals to control
complex motion. This means I get to use motion capture and virtual reality to
investigate animals' locomotor behaviors, and examine anatomy & physiology to
understand how these behaviors are made possible. This framework not only helps
us understand animals' capabilities, but also inspires engineering. Some of my
chief collaborators are engineers who incorporate biological insight into
designing structures with multi-functional capabilities.

Data from behavioral or physiological studies tend to be extremely noisy. Making
sense of information in these diverse data sets makes me appreciate statistical
methods and the design of effective visualizations. One of my favorite things to
do is help people think through these types of problems. If you think I can help
you, please feel free to reach out.
