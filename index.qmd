## Welcome to my personal site

I'm a data scientist who focuses on questions related to animal locomotion,
evolutionary biology, and physiology.

My research asks how musculoskeletal and visual systems allow animals to control
complex motion. This means I get to use motion capture and virtual reality to
investigate animals' locomotor behaviors, and examine anatomy & physiology to
understand how these behaviors are made possible. This framework not only helps
us understand animals' capabilities, but also inspires the development of
engineered structures. Some of my chief collaborators are engineers who
incorporate biological insight into designing structures with multi-functional
capabilities.

Making sense of information in diverse, noisy data makes me appreciate
statistical methods and the design of effective visualizations. Having the
chance to help others think through statistical problems is invigorating and
rewarding. The pages on this site should help give you a sense of my
professional interests and activities -- if you think I can help you, please
feel free to reach out.

That said, there is at least one other "Vikram Baliga" with whom you may have me
confused. If you are looking for the Vikram Baliga with more of a flare for
horticulture, [try this page
instead](https://www.podchaser.com/creators/vikram-baliga-107a4YrAy8). I'm the
Vikram Baliga who would [undoubtedly beat you in a James Harden look-alike
contest](/images/James-Harden.jpg) (though I can't say I'm a fan of Harden's
game).
