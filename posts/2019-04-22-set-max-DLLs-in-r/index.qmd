On occasion, you may need adjust the max number of .dll files that R can handle.
I first encountered this need when using a high number of packages together.

I've had trouble finding this info in the past, so I decided to create this post
for others. This works if you are using Windows.

The following is machine-specific, so you will need to do this on each computer
you run R.

## Find the `.Renviron` file

```{r}
#| eval: false
user_renviron <- 
  path.expand(file.path("~", ".Renviron"))
# check to see if the file already exists
# typically under: "C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/.Renviron"
if(!file.exists(user_renviron)) 
  file.create(user_renviron)
file.edit(user_renviron) 
```

If `file.edit(user_renviron)` fails to work, just open the file itself (located
wherever `user_renviron` is pointing) with a text editor.

## Edit max DLLs

Once you have the file open, edit or add the following line, save, and restart
R:

```{r}
#| eval: false
R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=500
```
