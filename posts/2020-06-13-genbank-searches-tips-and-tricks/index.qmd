This will be a "low-tech" post, i.e. one that doesn't showcase code.

Over the past few years, I've done a lot of searches for genetic sequences on
GenBank with the endgame of building phylogenetic trees. Here's a list of things
that have & haven't worked for me when it has come to the task of finding
specific genes for specific taxa.

A few good ways to set up the search term for nuclear genes are (ordered by
specificity):

-   `(Genus_species) NOT (whole genome) NOT predicted`
-   `(Genus_species) NOT (whole genome) NOT predicted NOT mitochondri\*`
-   `(Genus_species) NOT (whole genome) NOT predicted NOT mitochondri\*`

**Note 1**: I always avoid including sequences that have the word "predicted" in
the title; I'd rather rely on sequences that have established identity. That
said, including `NOT predicted` can be dangerous as the word "predicted" may
appear e.g. in the title of the corresponding paper, but the sequence itself may
be known with more certainty.

**Note 2**: For similar reasons, `NOT (whole genome)` may fare better than
`NOT genome`

**Note 3**: `OR` needs to be nested within parenthetical statements. Taking the
third bullet point as an example, a search without the the parentheses
surrounding the `OR` statement such as
`(Genus_species) NOT (whole genome) NOT predicted NOT mitochondri* AND gene1 OR gene2`
would amount to searching for
`(Genus_species) NOT (whole genome) NOT predicted NOT mitochondri* AND gene1` OR
`gene2`. Therefore, all cases of gene2 for every species ever would appear in
the search results!

Perhaps this list of notes will grow more someday, but that's all for now.
