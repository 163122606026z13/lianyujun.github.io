This works if you are using Windows.\n\nThe following is machine-specific, so you will need to do this on each computer\nyou run R.\n\n## Find the `.Renviron` file\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuser_renviron <- \n  path.expand(file.path(\"~\", \".Renviron\"))\n# check to see if the file already exists\n# typically under: \"C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/.Renviron\"\nif(!file.exists(user_renviron)) \n  file.create(user_renviron)\nfile.edit(user_renviron) \n```\n:::\n\n\nIf `file.edit(user_renviron)` fails to work, just open the file itself (located\nwherever `user_renviron` is pointing) with a text editor.\n\n## Edit max DLLs\n\nOnce you have the file open, edit or add the following line, save, and restart\nR:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nR_MAX_NUM_DLLS=500\n```\n:::\n\n\n🐢\n",
